# TISCH
[Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH)](http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/home/) is a scRNA-seq database, which focuses on tumor microenvironment (TME). TISCH provides detailed cell-type annotation for all curated datasets, enabling the exploration of TME across different cancer types.

## Release 1 - July 11th, 2020
### Data statistics
- **28 cancer types**.
- **79 datasets:** 15 datasets with ICB treatment (10 for human and 5 for mouse), 61 non-ICB datasets and 3 PBMC datasets.
- **2,045,746 cells:** 378,392 malignant cells and 1,667,354 non-malignant cells.

### Features
- **Gene module:** Search a gene across species and cancer types.
- **Single-dataset exploration:** 1. Overview of dataset; 2. Gene expression visualization at both single-cell level (UMAP plot) and cluster level (violin plot);
3. Functional enrichment analysis (GSEA); 4. Download files (cluster-level expression matrices, DE gene table and meta information).
- **Multiple-dataset comparison:** Compare expression of genes across multiple datasets.
